## The Problem at Hand 
The City of Toronto's transit system (the TTC), is notorious within the city for being [unreliable]([url](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/transit-in-toronto-has-never-felt-so-broken-it-s-time-for-the-ttc-board/article_4917e163-4ea2-58fa-9ba8-6fbcc5c685c9.html)) and [fundamentally flawed]([url](https://torontolife.com/deep-dives/who-broke-the-ttc-inside-torontos-public-transit-disaster/)https://torontolife.com/deep-dives/who-broke-the-ttc-inside-torontos-public-transit-disaster/). The general mistrust of the public transportation can drive people towards other modes of transportation (most notably, personal vehicle travel), which has the impact of further delaying road-based public transportation. 

Our objective was to understand how the delays and reliability of the TTC compares to other transit systems in Canada. Due to limitations in data availability, the city of Montreal's subway system was used to compare to the TTC's subway system and the city of Calgary's bus system.
